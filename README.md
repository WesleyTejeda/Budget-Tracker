## Description
In this repository I've created a site that tracks your expenses and deposits while offline or online. Utilizing service workers, the website is stored in cache to be accessed in offline mode. Posts made in offline mode are stored in indexedDB and will sync back with MongoDB when online. Through these two processes we can keep the app up to date.

## Installation
Install using ```npm install```
Dependancies used: Express, Mongoose, Morgan, Compression, Lite-Server, & DotEnv
## Usage
After installations, if you wish to run this locally, the database will be created for you when you run the program using ```npm start```.
